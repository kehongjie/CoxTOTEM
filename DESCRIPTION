Title: A Cox Model based Two-stage Variable Selection Method for Multiple Studies
Version: 1.0
Date: 2020-04-12
Description: The package implements a Cox model based two-stage variable selection
    method for the detection of survival associated biomarkers with multiple 
    genomic studies. In the first stage, it performs sure screening with multiple
    studies in high-dimensional Cox model, and in the second stage, it penalizes 
    the partial likelihood with a group lasso penalty to select the final set of 
    variables in all studies simultaneously.
